Do you know I like to program in GO?
  
I am a GO trainer, a GO Principal Developer and a Senior Software Architect.

## ðŸ’¬  Stuff that I promote:
- the KISS principle (Keep It Stupid Simple)
- think first, code later
- clean architecture
- TDD

## âš¡  Fun fact:
I don't know how to do any other profession
